# Invisible-Cloak
 Invisible Cloak is a Python project that creates a visual effect similar to an invisibility cloak using computer vision techniques. By leveraging color detection and masking, the program makes a specific colored object (e.g., a red cloth) appear invisible against a live video feed.
